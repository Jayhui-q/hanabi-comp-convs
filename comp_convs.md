# Competition Convention Catalogue

This document records all of the Hanabi convention history for all of the Hanabi competitions that I played in previously, and will be regularly updated (with up to a month's delay) after a competition ends. Our hope is that these conventions serve as inspiration for fellow competitors, future community conventions, or as just fun ideas to ruminate on about the way the game could be played. 

These competitions are played on https://hanab.live/ and are located at https://hanabi-competitions.com/.

As a reminder, these competitions have bottom-deck blind-play enabled and also have a turn count emphasis -- are designed with the goal of performing well in the competitions and may not be optimal for synchronous performance in normal games. They were also practiced with at-length (!) 

Massive massive credits go to **rkass, avanderwalde, kevincaseytdk1, and kyle** for being a amazing parts of my competition teams and all of the awesome memories we have made together in these competitions.

As usual, Alice, Bob, Cathy, Donald, and Emily are names used for players in that order. 
Alice is assumed to be the person performing the action unless otherwise noted.

## 3p No Variant [9/14]
### General Notes
* Loaded play clues are turned on in mid-game.
* No 5-Stalls are allowed in early game (unless left with 8 clues, DDA, or otherwise locked). 
* Delaying blind-plays for priority reasons is strictly illegal.

### Allowable Chop Moves
* In early game, chop moves are only allowed on 2's and 5's.
* This serves to faciliate reads on what the chop moved cards are for blind-plays without any additional context.

### Priority Changes
* Priority bluffs can always be done out of position. That is, if Alice commits a play out of priority, and Bob sees a playable card on finesse, Bob is not promised a playable or the matching card on finesse. Instead, Cathy is asked to blind-play.
* For two playables that aren't completely known, the card that was most recently clued has the priority.

### 4 Double Bluff Override
* When deciding between a 4 double bluff and a finesse, the player should assess whether or not it will take him or her 2+ blind-plays to fufill the finesse. If so, then it is a double bluff. Otherwise it is a finesse.
* This comes at a very noticeable tradeoff of giving a 4 as a finesse when Bob has two or more cards of the matching suit.

### 5s Chop Move Assumption
* Even if a player is in DDA or is another stall situation, a 5 clue that is 1 away from chop is still read as a chop move.

## 4p Rainbow (6 Suits) [9/28]  -- "Clue Partners"
In this competition, players were only allowed to clue accross the table. That is, Alice may only clue Cathy, Bob may only clue Donald, Cathy may only clue Alice, and Donald may only clue Bob.
