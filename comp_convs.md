# Competition Convention Catalogue

This document records all of the Hanabi convention history for all of the Hanabi competitions that I played in previously, and will be regularly updated (with up to a month's delay) after a competition ends. Our hope is that these conventions serve as inspiration for fellow competitors, future community conventions, or as just fun ideas to ruminate on about the way the game could be played. 

These competitions are played on https://hanab.live/ and are located [here](https://hanabi-competitions.com/).

The conventions below all build upon community conventions found [here](https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/blob/master/Reference.md). If they are not specified to be altered by a competition-specific convention, then the community conventions were assumed. As a reminder, these competitions have bottom-deck blind-play enabled and also have a turn count emphasis -- they are designed with the goal of performing well in the competitions and may not be optimal for synchronous performance in normal games. In addition, they were playtested with a specific number of players in mind (as compared to being applicable for 3-6 players). They were also practiced with at-length (!) 

Massive massive credits go to **rkass, avanderwalde, kevincaseytdk1, and kyle** for being a amazing parts of my competition teams and all of the awesome memories we have made together in these competitions.

As usual, Alice, Bob, Cathy, Donald, and Emily are names used for players in that order. 
Alice is assumed to be the person performing the action unless otherwise noted. 

# 2020 T3 Standard Series
Results can be found [here](https://hanabi-competitions.com/series/2020%20T3%20Standard)

2p White Reversed (6 Suits), and 2p Clue Starved (6 Suits) are ommitted, as I did not compete in either. 2020 T3 Standard Series was our team's first competition series.

For all 3 player competitions, the team composition was avanderwalde, rkass, and I (JerryYang).
For all 4 player competitions, the team composition included kevincaseytdk1 as well.

## 3p No Variant [9/14]
### General Notes
* Loaded play clues are turned on in mid-game.
* No 5-Stalls are allowed in early game (unless left with 8 clues, DDA, or otherwise locked). 
* Delaying blind-plays for priority reasons is strictly illegal.

#### Allowable Chop Moves
* In early game, chop moves are only allowed on 2's and 5's.
* This serves to faciliate reads on what the chop moved cards are for blind-plays without any additional context.

#### Priority Changes
* Priority bluffs can always be done out of position. That is, if Alice commits a play out of priority, and Bob sees a playable card on finesse, Bob is not promised a playable or the matching card on finesse. Instead, Cathy is asked to blind-play.
* For two playables that aren't completely known, the card that was most recently clued has the priority.

#### 4 Double Bluff Override
* When deciding between a 4 double bluff and a finesse, the player should assess whether or not it will take him or her 2+ blind-plays to fufill the finesse. If so, then it is a double bluff. Otherwise it is a finesse.
* This comes at a very noticeable tradeoff of giving a 4 as a finesse when Bob has two or more cards of the matching suit.

#### 5s Chop Move Assumption
* Even if a player is in DDA or is another stall situation, a 5 clue that is 1 away from chop is still read as a chop move.

## 4p Rainbow (6 Suits) [9/28]  -- "Clue Partners"
In this competition, players were only allowed to clue accross the table. That is, Alice may only clue Cathy, Bob may only clue Donald, Cathy may only clue Alice, and Donald may only clue Bob.

### General Notes
* Unnecessary Interpretations are **almost always off**. After all, there are only 4 possible cards to touch.
* It is strictly illegal to delay a finesse with a bluff. We found the risk too high when clues were difficult to give to re-sync the team.
* 4 Double Bluff Override is on.
* DDA is on, Loaded Play clues are off, and 5 stalls in early game are off unless in a stall sitaution.

### Duplication 1 Conventions
These conventions refer to when a player has unknown 1's in their hand. They are created because sometimes only the player with the 1s can clue the other player with 1s.

#### 1 Color Promise
* If Alice has an unknown 1, and clues color to Cathy's chop, and it is not a finesse or bluff, then Cathy is promised that color 1 (not rainbow).
* Note: Alice should not do the 1 Color Promise if that card is not unique on the table (for example, if Bob also has the same 1).

#### Multi 1 Promise
* If Alice has an unknown 1, and clues a rank 1 to Cathy's Chop, and it is not a bluff or push, then Cathy is promised multi 1 on chop. If multiple 1's are touched, Cathy should assume all 1's are good until a fix is given.
* Note: Alice should not do the multi 1 promise if that card is not unique on the table.

#### Duplication 1's Chop Move
* If Alice has an unknown 1, and clues a 1 that is not on chop, the clue receiver should chop move (as the 1 clue was clearly urgent). Cathy should assume all 1's are good until a fix is given.

### Early Game Conventions
#### Early Game Quarantine
* On turns 1-2, discarding is prohibited. On turns 3-4, if a player was chop saved via a direct clue or order chop move, discarding is also prohibited (as no one may have had the chance to save you). Stall clues must be given instead. 
* In addition, if your clue partner was forced into blind-playing, then you are also prohibited from discarding. 
* A player can only end early-game when their partner had the opportunity to save them, and did not.

#### Opening Clue Burn
* A 4 rank clue given on turns 1 and 2 is simply a burn unless other players could see a better clue to be given. 
* On the 4-clue receivers' first turn, the clued 4 is considered the chop (i.e. discard the 4, from left to right if there are multiple).  An opening 4 clue'd card that is not discarded immediately is no longer considered trash, and should be kept as good touch
* Choosing to not discard the leftmost clued 4 is a * scream discard * 
* If on turn 1 Alice sees that Cathy has only 2s and 3s without a 2 on chop, Alice should clue number 2 to Cathy’s non-chop. Bob can see that Alice had nothing better to do and will not play into it as a finesse. Cathy assumes that a 1 would have been given for clarity if it were a self-finesse. 

#### 5s Chop Move Candidates
* A 5 CM in early game must either be on a good 2 or the duplicate of the card to the left of it.
* Do not CM an arbitrary 3 / 4 in the early game - you are likely to lock the player. If another player has this same 3 / 4 on chop it is OK to cm this. Note that toward mid/late game you can cm an arbitrary good 3 / 4 especially if it is 1 away from playable.

### Other Conventions
#### Duplication UTD
* If two good cards are intentionally duplicated with a clue, then the clue calls for a discharge on the very next player (play -> trash/dupe)

#### Modified Stall Clues
* In DDA, scream discard, locked hand or 8 clues, a stall clue must be given in the follow order of precedence.
  1. Non-chop color play clue
  2. Chop-focus save or direct play clue
  3. 5 stall (touching a new 5)
  4. Tempo Clue
  5. Fill-in Clue
  6. Clear Burn Clue (e.g. re-clue known 5s, reclue known cards with number)
  7. Number clue not on chop. (Considered good touch, but not asked to be played)

* If other players could see a better clue to be given, then it is in fact a play clue to be played into by others and the clue receiver will only know after a blind-play is done. 
* NOTE: there is no such thing as a locked hand save. This is done so clues on chop can actually have meaning. Stall situations are a common occurrence in this competition.

#### Occupied 1-1 Chop Move (Mid-Game)
* A 1 for 1 play clue that does not touch chop when a player has something to do chop moves the clue receiver. That is, if Alice gives a 1 for 1 to Cathy when Alice already has a play, Cathy should chop move. If the clue was to a chop card this is a normal play / save that does not call for a chop move.

#### Bad Tempo Clue Bluff 
* Alice can give a tempo clue to Cathy that would chop move a trash card in order to get Bob to play his finesse position (not a clue on something globally known as playable, otherwise it's a double play ejection). To counteract the chop move on a bad card, Bob blind-plays.
* NOTE: bear in mind that a tempo clue does not call for a chop move when the clue giver is in a stall situation and could not see other play/save clues to give in their partner's hand.

#### 1-Away Scream
* If Alice is left with 0 clues and Bob has a critical card on chop, Alice should trust that the team has permitted her to perform a 1-Away Scream. That is, Alice discards 1 slot to the left of chop rather than her chop. 
* Following the 1-away scream, Bob should chop move.

#### Blazing Lies
* If a gentleman’s discard occurs that lies about the position of the card but gets a free finesse position play, but it can be fixed with a single clue, it is not a blaze discard. Instead it is a layered gentleman's discard with a fix.
* For example, supposed blue 1 and green 1 is on the stacks. Alice discards a playable and clued blue 2. Cathy's hand holds a playable red 1 on finesse, followed by green 1, and blue 2. 
* In the blazing lie convention, Bob should not blind-play his third finesse position. Instead, Bob should let Cathy play slot 1 as red 1, and know that Alice will fix it in the next turn.
* This convention is created due to the unlikelihood of blazes (when players in this ruleset are often giving immediate play clues), as well as permitting transfers of cards from Alice to Bob or Alice to Donald more smoothly. 
* Note,  you cannot “skip fixing” (as a weird way of trying to rewrite original as a blazing truth)

#### End-Game Color Choice
* In end-game, if a rainbow card could have been focused by rank, and is instead focused by color, it is an ask for the very next player to play the slot corresponding to the stacks. (Purple is slot 4, Blue is slot 3, Green is slot 2, Yellow is slot 1, and red is an undefined emergency, signalling that it was unfocusable)

#### End-Game Desperation
* If you cannot use either of the other conventions to get a particular card to play as a last ditch desperation you can try a number clue to give the slot to be played. Do not use this unless there is no other mechanism - the end game color choice signaling red may be stronger.

## 3p Duck (5 Suits) [10/26]
### General Notes
* All hyphenated conventions apply unless this document conflicts with hyphenated, in which case conventions in this document take precedence. See [Duck](https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/blob/master/variant-specific/Duck.md) and [No Positive Clues](https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/blob/master/variant-specific/No_Positive_Clues.md) (In particular, 1’s promise, 3 discharge, and 4 charm)
* Keep an eye out for occupied play clues

### Conventions Switched Off
* Bluffs (except for when bluffing out 5's)
* Hesitation Blind-Play
* Tempo Clue Chop Moves, Order Chop Moves
* DDA
* 5 Chop Move, Stall, Pull, and its extensions
* Priority Finesse, Prompt, Bluff
* Double Finesses
* Fake Saves
* Relaxed 2 Saves

### Additional Conventions
#### LPC and OPC
* Loaded Play Clues and Occupied Play Clues are always on the entire game, even in early game
* Addendum: For clarity, occupied play clues are stricly only when Alice clues Cathy

#### Promised Play Order
* Play clues and prompts should always be played in the order that they were received (unless it is clear that they are both directly playable)

#### 1's Re-Clue Order
* Often in the beginning of the game 1’s are clued on chop and then subsequently re-clued in order to communicate that they are 1’s. In this case, the recipient should play their 1’s from right to left, stopping after playing a non-1.

#### DDA Responsbility
* DDA is off. In the event that the next two players do not have a play and they have identical cards on chop, you should save the first player's discard. This clue is read as a save, unless the discard that occurs does not match the initial clue. 
  * The player who received the clue should mark down all cards in trash as well as the very next player’s chop (and play or other save interpretations)
* If you are in DDA and see a play clue or save clue to give you must give it

#### 2/5 Color Save Finesse 
* When a color clue rather than number is clearly given (via other touched cards) to a non critical 2 or a 5, this is read as a finesse/ejection (as it would be in normal game).

#### Modified Stall Sequence
If a player is screamed at, has 8 clues without a playable, or has a locked hand, they should follow the below priority when cluing. 
  1. Normal play/save clue 
  2. Burn clue (refocuses a card that was already clued. Should not trigger a DPE or a tempo clue if no normal play/saves can be seen) 
  3. Locked Hand Save (not promised good) 

So in a stall situation, if Cathy has a card that could've been focused in as a burn, but Alice clues something not playable /saveable on Cathy's chop instead, Bob reads it as a finesse, or a special move. Alternatively, if Cathy sees that a direct play clue/save clue could've been given (not a possible dupe), then Cathy knows that a burn to her was indeed a tempo clue or a clue to chop was a play/save

#### UTD Suppress
* Unknown Trash Discharges are turned off (this includes duplication discharges) until all of the 1’s have been played, because at this point 3 discharges are impossible. 
* This is done so that a player knows whether or not to write a 3 on their card (via a 3 discharge) or kt.

#### Double Finesse Suppress
* Double Finesses are turned off in favor of ejections, discharges, and charms which may be performed out of order as well. 
* For example:
  * Red 1 on stacks. Bob has a Red 2 which has been clued as a play. Alice quacks at Bob's Blue 3. Bob plays Red 2. Cathy plays her discharge signaling that Bob’s Blue 3 was clued as a 3 discharge.

#### Chop Moved Finessable 
* Cards which have been chop moved are counted as untouched when counting finesse positions and are therefore eligible to be finessed, ejected, discharged, and charmed.

#### Early 5-5 Blast
* In early game, if someone has a fifth finesse position, a 5 clue to a two or more away from playable card that’s not on chop is a signal for the next person to play their fifth finesse position. (early game ends when unknown trash gets discarded)
* If a player does not have a fifth finesse position, it’s a normal 5 ejection
* Cannot be performed out of position

#### Special Move Finesse Default
* If a special move is given and the target does not have the corresponding finesse position, it’s a finesse. For example, if a 3 discharge is given from Alice to Cathy but Bob doesn’t have a 3rd finesse position, this is a finesse.

#### Half Information Prompt Rule
* When deciding between a prompt or a finesse, a prompt should be chosen if the information on that card matches at least half-way. That is, after getting information about a previous clue that could’ve been either a rank or a color clue, those respective colors count towards choosing a prompt over a finesse to connect into a matching clue. NOTE: this rule only applies to cards that are not known to be playable. 
* Example 1:
  * Red 1 and Blue 1 are on the stacks 
  * Alice quacks at Bob’s slot 1 and slot 2
  * Bob plays slot 1 and sees that it is red 2. Bob marks that his slot 2 is either red or 2. 
  * Cathy clues a blue 3 to Alice, and Bob is promised b2 on his slot 2, unless Alice blind-plays.
* Example 2:
  * Alice quacks at Cathy’s slot 1 and 2
  * Bob plays his charm slot, indicating to Cathy that her slot 1 is a 4. 
  * Later, Alice clues Bob a b3, which is not playable.
  * Cathy should not play her prompt. Instead the clue is either a finesse or a special move.

#### Chop Prompt Exception
* Cards clued on chop in early game should never be played as 1-prompts or 2-prompts unless there is context to rule them out as 5’s

#### Out-Of-Position Specials
* Because of play-order promise, special moves can be done out of position with clarity. For clarity, the special moves can only be done a player that is already loaded. 
* Otherwise, it is a finesse or prompt.

#### Double Save Rewrite
* If a clue to chop that was initially seen as LPC is followed up immediately by another clue to chop, both should be assumed as saves.

#### Unnecessary dupe 1's at Beginning Game
* If a player holds 1s and decides to give 1s as a play clue, and the very next player has a blast spot, then the next player should eject.

#### Re-clue Right Focus Exception
* If a card is already determined, then a clue that re-clues more than 1 card is focused on the non-determined card

#### End-Game Double Plays
* When all 4 cards are either on the stacks or globally known, then it is possible to perform an unnecessary trash bluff. Once this is given, two plays are called for, read as a trash pull or trash push. If neither of these are playable, then it is a special move and not a trash bluff. 
  * For example: Alice clues Cathy trash on slot 3 Because all 4’s are down or clued, Cathy could not possibly read it as a finesse if Bob plays slot 1. Bob suspects this is an unnecessary trash pull. Bob looks at Cathy’s slot 4, to the right of the trash card. If it is playable, Bob knows that he should play finesse to trigger the trash pull. 
  * If Bob doesn’t see that the trash push/pull is playable, then Bob should discharge like a normal UTD. If Cathy sees this UTD was unnecessary and trash would not be valuable, Cathy plays her finesse position. Beyond positional misplays, this covers Bob’s slot 1 and slot 3 and any slot of Cathy

#### Playable 4’s non-screamable
* A player may not scream to save a playable, non-critical 4

#### 2 Save Obligation 
* Relaxed 2 Saves, from the Duck document, is off.
* Without context, you have to save 2 even if you might have the matching 2 in hand. 

#### Sarcastic Assumption
* You don’t need half information to assume sarcastic. 
* That said, gentlemans are still possible if you can rule out sarcastic. 

#### "Tempo clues" may be delayed play clues, or finesses

#### DPE vs Trash Fix
* A clue focusing a playable card on Bob is a trash fix. On Cathy, it’s a DPE.
* DPEs can only be given on clued cards (not finessed, known "playables")

## 3p Prism (6 Suits) 11/09
* Coming Soon! I got carried away by Detrimental Characters.

## 4p Rainbow (6 Suits) / Detrimental Characters 
This competition features a specific detriment assigned to each player at the beginning of the game. Below are conventions and strategies by detriment.
### Clue Giving Restricted 
*Characters in this class are limited by the types of clues they may give*

### Clue Giving Restricted Save (CGR Save)
* If a color clue is given by this player to another player’s chop, this clue should be interpreted as a save clue. The exception to this is when the clue giver’s detriment could not have inhibited them from giving a normal save clue. 
* If the player receiving a CGR Save is loaded (has a play on this turn or known trash to discard), then this clue is a play clue.
* If the player giving the CGR Save is meaningfully occupied (there was another player who could’ve given this clue and the clue giver had a play), then this clue is a play clue.
	* Example (CGR Save):
		* Dumbfounded Alice can only clue color and 3. Nothing is in the trash. Nothing is on the stacks.
  	* Alice clues blue to Bob on chop
  	* Bob sees that it’s impossible for Alice to 2 or 5 save Bob, so Bob marks his chop a blue 2 or blue 5
  
  * Example (Not a CGR Save)
  	* Dumbfounded Alice can only clue color and 5. Nothing is in the trash. All 2’s are on the stacks.
  	* Alice clues blue to Bob on chop
  	* Bob sees that Alice could have said 5 if this was a blue 5, so Bob marks his chop as a playable blue card

  * Example (LPC)
  	* Dumbfounded Alice can only clue color and 3. Nothing is in the trash. Nothing is on the stacks. Bob has a known playable g1.
  	* Alice clues blue to Bob on chop
  	* Bob sees that it’s impossible for Alice to 2 or 5 save Bob, but Bob also realizes he’s loaded. Since CGR Saves may not be given when loaded, Bob marks his chop as playable.
		
  * Example (Non-CGR Save Non-LPC) 
  	* Dumbfounded Alice can only clue color and 3. blue 4 is in the trash. Nothing is on the stacks. Bob has a known playable g1.
  	* Alice clues blue to Bob’s chop
  	* Bob sees that this clue may be targeting a blue 4, which is in the trash so his interpretation is that this is not a CGR Save, but it’s a normal save. Since we don’t play with LPC for normal save, Bob marks his slot 5 as blue 4.

#### Fuming
* Can only clue numbers and [random color].
#### Dumbfounded
* Can only clue colors and [random number]
#### Inept
* Cannot give any clues that touch [random color] cards
* Strategies
  * When receiving a clue from an inept player, all players should write negative [color] notes on the clued cards
#### Awkward
* Cannot give any clues that touch [random number] cards
* Strategies
  * When receiving a clue from an awkward player, all players should write negative [number] notes on the clued cards
#### Conservative
* Can only give clues that touch a single card
* Notes
  * If a player has 2 rainbow cards in hand, they can no longer receive color clues from this person
#### Greedy
* Can only give clues that touch 2+ cards
#### Picky
* Can only give clues that touch odd colors/numbers
* Notes
  * The choices are 1/3/5 + r/g/p
  * This player is unable to initiate 4 double bluffs. 
  * This player cannot save y24/b24
#### Compulsive
* Can only clue if it touches slot 1 or slot 4
* Notes
  * This player has lots of trouble saving cards once chop has moved
  * This player has more flexibility to use trash chop moves whenever they wish. This only applies when attempting to save cards in slot 2 or 3 and should be left to other players if it is convenient to do so.

#### Mood Swings
* Clues given must alternate between color and number
#### Quacker
* Can only quack instead of clue
* Conventions
  * LPC is always on for the Quacker in non-stall situations. Every quack on a player that has a known trash or playable card is a play clue. Otherwise a clue to chop from Quacker is always read first as a save clue.
  * 4 Charms vs Double Bluff
   	* A quack to a 4 that is two-or-more-away from playable from Quacker Alice to Donald is a 4 charm (as opposed to a 4DB) if Bob sees that Cathy does not have a directly playable card on finesse. 
   	* If Bob cannot see Cathy’s finesse, we will play that this is a 4 double bluff.
  * 5 Number Discharges, Pulls, cm’s are turned into 5 color ejections.
  * Assume Finesse/Prompt if Possible
  * If you receive a quack as a play clue the target player must entertain that it’s through any cards on other peoples’ finesse or any clued cards which are playable.
  * An early-game clue from quacker should be read as any other clue, playing left to right (as you can not determine if it is a 1).
  * If a 1 is played, then the other cards lumped together with it are assumed to be 1s and should be played until a lie is revealed. SEE the community duck [convention](https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/blob/master/variant-specific/Duck.md#the-1s-promise-play-lie)
  * Order chop moves are off, as you don’t know which order
  * Note That Quacker can not give 5 stalls in the stall sequence, nor are fill-in clues distinguishable from burns:
   	* Just skip these in order, and assume that the clue is a burn from quacker or a locked hand save.
  * See: Duck Conventions Above

### Clue Recipient Restricted
*Characters in this class are limited by whom they may clue*
* Note that the next player whom Spiteful may not clue and the previous player whom Insolent may not clue does not change when play order shifts via Contrarian * 

#### Spiteful
* Cannot clue the next player
#### Insolent
* Cannot clue the previous player

### Clue Receiving Restricted
*Characters in this class are limited by the types of clues they may receive.*
### Clue Receiving Restricted Save (CRR Save)
* If a color clue is to this player’s chop, this clue should be interpreted as a save clue. The exception to this is when the clue receiver’s detriment could not have inhibited them from receiving a normal save clue. If the player receiving a CRR Save is loaded (has a play on this turn or known trash to discard), then this clue is a play clue. This convention is the receiver’s analog to the CGR Save
  * Example (Not a CRR Save):
   	* Vulnerable Bob cannot receive number 2 or number 5 clues. Bob has a known playable g1 in his hand. There is a p4 in the trash.
   	* Alice clues Bob 1 purple touching his chop card
   	* Since there is a valid interpretation of this clue that makes it not a CR save but a normal save, Bob will interpret this as a normal save clue and will write p4 on his chop card.
  * Example (Loaded CRR Save)
   	* Vulnerable Bob cannot receive number 2 or number 5 clues. Bob has a known playable g1 in his hand. There is a p4 in the trash.
   	* Alice clues Bob 1 purple touching his chop card
   	* Since there is a valid interpretation of this clue that makes it not a CR save but a normal save, Bob will interpret this as a normal save clue and will write p4 on his chop card.
   	* Cathy observes that Bob's chop card is a p2 and concludes that Alice was performing a loaded CR save. Seeing that p2 is not playable
   	* Cathy plays her finesse position and it’s p1
   	* Bob goes back and marks his chop as p2

#### Vulnerable
* Cannot receive a number 2 or number 5 clue
* Conventions
  * Save 2’s and 5’s with color. These clues behave as CGR Saves.
#### Color-blind
* Cannot receive a color clue
* Note that Genius can not clue this character
* Conventions
  * 2 saves on this player are loaded.
  * No Rank choice ejection or suboptimal bluff/finesse

### Action Restricted
*Characters in this class are limited by the types of action they can perform on a given turn*

#### Miser
* Can only clue if there are 4 or more clues available
* Notes
  * They don’t have to clue if there are 4 or more clues available. E.g. can still play or discard.
* Strategies
  * A miser might be unable to clue in a DDA situation. It’s up to the 2 players that can see the Miser and the player before the Miser to orchestrate the game so that even if the miser discards in DDA we will be ok

#### Follower
* Cannot play a card unless two cards of that same rank have already
* Notes
  * If the card would be played successfully but violate this rule, you’ll get a strike instead
  * It can be very difficult to demonstrate blind plays as follower
  * As a general rule of thumb, it may be a bad thing to give more clued cards to the follower, as it may quickly get congested.
* Turn off suboptimal bluff for clues given to follower
* Conventions
  * **Blind Trust**
   	* If the follower being asked to blind play into a finesse that should play successfully, the follower will blind play into it. If the follower has no chance of blind playing any card that would work, the blind play/bluff is passed to the next player
  * **Certain Unplayable Finesse**
   	* Unplayable Finesses on Followers are certain finesses and are promised to be on slot 1.
   	* For example:
     	* All of the 3s are on the stacks and no 4s are on the stacks.
     	* Alice clues Cathy’s y5 with color. 
     	* Bob can’t play y4. This does not trigger the blind-trust, since every card that could be played is not legal to be played. Instead Bob will write y4 

#### Indolent
* Cannot play a card if the played on the last round
* Notes
  * Give this player as few plays as possible.
  * Avoid using bluff targets in this players hand
#### Hesitant
* Cannot play cards from slot 1
* Notes
* Be careful that they won’t be able to play slot 1 when thinking about order chop moves, fresh 1s, and general priority moves.
* Conventions
  * **Finesse Shift**
   	* All finesse positions are shifted by 1 slot, so slot 2 is finesse, slot 3 is ejection, and slot 4 is discharge. This player does not have a charm slot, and when finessed or bluffed, plays s2 in order to resolve it immediately.
  * **Layered Finesse Ordering**
   	* Finesse ordering is slot 2, slot 1, slot 3, slot 4
   	* Finesse ordering goes from the left-most unclued card that is not s1, and then your second finesse position is what would be your left-most unclued card after playing that card.
   	* The layered finesse ordering does not apply until a finesse is called for and revealed to be layered. That is, a hesitant player should treat their finesse positions as if it only contained the 3 cards (slot 2,3,4) until a finesse is revealed to be clandestine/layered.
  * **Blaze and Gentlemans**
Gentlemans Discards go according to the layered finesse ordering. For example a gentleman’s discard on y4 is correct here with no fix: r4, y4, g4, b4. A discard of r4 on this hand would need a blaze for finesse position. A discard of g4 to this hand would need a blaze for ejection. A discard of b4 would need a blaze for discharge.
#### Anxious
* Cannot discard if there is an even number of clues available (including 0)
* Notes
  * If left with 0 clues, this player will blind play their most likely playable card as an anxiety play
  * This player will often be in a stalling situation
#### Traumatized
* Cannot discard if there is an odd number of clues available
* Notes
  * This player will often be in a stalling situation
#### Wasteful
* Cannot discard if there are 2 or more clues available
* Notes
  * This player will often be in a stalling situation
#### Stubborn
* Must perform a different action type than the player that came before them
* Notes
  * LPC is almost always off for this player. It can be very useful to early save something because if the player before stubborn plays, stubborn may be forced to discard even with a play.
  * Out of position priority bluffs are on, around this player. That is if Alice does a priority move that is not a prompt, preceding a stubborn Bob, Bob should think that Cathy’s finesse is being called for as the priority bluff.

### Information Restricted
*Characters in this class cannot see certain cards in their teammates’ hands* 
### 4 Number Double Bluff Override: 
* If a 4 number (must be known to be a play clue, not a stall/save) is given and it is at least 2-away, (its respective 2 is not yet on the stack), this is always a 4s double bluff. If the player with information restriction does not know what color the 4 is, but there are no 2s on the stack at the time the clue is given, they will still assume it is a 4s double bluff. If you are looking for a true prompt/finesse, please use color instead. If color is not possible because of a blocking card, then sadly you must wait for a better opportunity. If playable cards are known to everyone, it counts as being “on the stacks” if the color of the 4 is known to the information restricted character, but is considered not on the stacks when evaluating the unknown 4 case.

* Example: Unknown 4 masterfully deceives Bob into a 4 double bluff 
	* Only r1 is on the stacks
	* Alice                                        y3, r2, m4, y2
  * Bob (Blind spot of Cathy)                    b1, b4, g2, p5
  * Cathy                                        y1, r4, b3, b5
  * Donald                                       m5, g5, y5, r2 (known r2)
* Alice knows that Bob can’t see Cathy, so can cue up this r4 with 4. Bob and Cathy will both blind play here, despite Donald scratching his head because technically the r4 is one away from playable (because r2 is known and about to play). Side note: Alice cluing red to Cathy is terrible, since Bob and Cathy both write r3 on the card and Bob won’t play. It is unlikely we could recover from that.


* Example: Unknown 4 with a 2 on the stacks is not a double bluff
  * Only r2 is on the stacks
  * Alice                                        y3, r5, m4, b2
  * Bob (Blind spot of Cathy)                    b1, b4, g2, p5
  * Cathy                                        r3, r4, b3, b5
  * Donald                                       b1, r1, y5, y5
* Alice clues 4 to Cathy. Bob should respect that this is possibly r4 and should not play. Cathy 
blind plays r3 and will write r4 on her 4 since 3 matches 4. Note that if Cathy plays y1, Cathy will 
write r4 on her 4 since Alice can bluff Cathy. If Cathy instead plays y1 from slot 1, and the 4 is actually g4, this could be an OOP double bluff on Cathy + Donald, but try to avoid this since it’s likely Bob will cue up b1 himself.

* Example: Known 4 with an irrelevant 2 on the stacks is still a double bluff
  * Only r2 is on the stacks
  * Alice                                        y3, r5, m4, y2
  * Bob (Blind spot of Cathy)                    b1, b4, g2, p5
  * Cathy                                        r3, r4, b3, b5
  * Donald                                       r1, g5, y4, r1
  * Alice clues 4 to Donald. Even though r2 is on the stacks Bob knows that y4 is 3 away from playable making this a 4 double bluff. Bob and Cathy both play

* Example: Don’t be rude, try to give the easiest Double Bluff if you want a Double Bluff
  * R1 and g1 is on the stacks, no discards
  * Alice                                        y3, r5, m4, r2
  * Bob (Blind spot of Cathy)                    m5, b4, g2, g1
  * Cathy                                        r3, r4, g3, g1
  * Donald                                       r1, g5, y4, r2 (known r2)
* If Alice clues 4 to Cathy, Bob is in a sticky spot because Bob knows Alice could have easily 
double bluffed on the y4. Bob should not play, and Cathy should guess she has r3 in slot 1. 
Note that although Alice can bluff Cathy, Cathy will assume she has r3 as a (possibly stacked) 
finesse because Cathy must wait for r2 to play before Cathy can respond which would destroy a 
potential bluff here.

### Rank Choice Bluff: 
* This is actually just a specialization of the community [convention](https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/blob/master/Reference.md#the-rank-choice-bluff). If you have free choice between 4 and color, the 4 number calls for a double bluff, and the color calls for a true finesse, even if the true finesse requires many blind plays. If 4 or color would touch multiple cards, this does not apply and players will have to use best judgement.
* As per our normal conventions - if two or more blind plays are needed from a single player then this is always a 4 double bluff. Information restricted characters may not be able to prove whether 2 or more blind plays are needed from a single player, so refer to 4NDBO above, which TL;DR says if a 4 number is given and it’s 2 is not yet on the stacks it’s probably a double bluff.

#### Blind Spot
* Cannot see the cards of the next player
* Strategy
  * **Shrouded Cluemaster**: If the shrouded player can avoid discarding as compared to the last 2 players, the optimal way to proceed is to have the shrouded player giving most of the clues. The game will flow using 3 player’s hands, completely eliminating the detriment of blind-spot. The way to orchestrate this is that the shrouded player takes more aggressive clue giving, such as early saves or even pang of guilt. The last 2 players aggressively discard, and it’s ok for blind spot to discard normally. Of course this is not possible if the shrouded player begins the game with many plays, or if the last 2 players need to avoid discarding.
  * If you want blind-spot to blind play the player before blind spot can bluff/finesse. If you want both blind-spot and shrouded to blind play, use the 4s number double bluff override, pestilence, double ignition. If you want only shrouded to blind-play: sadly this is basically impossible. Given this the shrouded player is a terrible player to be picking up playables.
* Conventions
  * Order Chop Moves skip the next player (because they can’t be cm’ing a player they can’t see)
  * Bluff seat skips the next player. Blind Alice is in Cathy’s bluff seat. 
  * **Order Blind-Play Assumption**
   	* A player with the blind-spot will assume the following:
   	* A clue to them or their shrouded player is a direct play clue if they don’t have information to show otherwise (like a finesse card on the players they can see)
   	* Assume that a blind-plays are being asked for in order. That is, if a blind-play is being asked for and you can not see it on someone’s finesse, you should blind-play. You should not assume that the person you can not see will fulfill this. This does not apply for prompts.
   	* This has a couple of implications
     	* Rank clues to the shrouded player or to the person with the detriment can be utilized to self-bluff or self-finesse the blind-spot player. That is, if they can prove that any blind-plays will be needed, they will blind-play.
     	* Pestilent double bluffs are easier to construct when you know the first player will always blind-play from it. 
     	* Color clues to the shrouded or blind-spot player are almost never finesses on each other, unless it can be proven otherwise
   	* Another way of thinking about this is the following:
     	* The blind-spot player plays the game as if she has 8 cards but all as one player. If one of her cards is being prompted, that’s great, and she should entertain it. Otherwise she will blind-play as if she is playing 3-player.
  
* Here are a few examples, in all of these examples, Bob is the blind-spot player and Cathy is the shrouded player
  * EXAMPLE: Self-bluff
   	* Nothing is on the stacks
   	* Alice clues Bob a 3 clue. As long as Bob does not see a 1 in Donald’s finesse, Bob plays his finesse position (slot 2) as a self-bluff, not entertaining that it is a finesse on cards
  * EXAMPLE: Basic Assumed Finesse/Bluff
   	* M1 is on the stacks. (Importantly, no 2s are on the stacks! Otherwise this is assumed direct-play)
   	* Alice clues Cathy a 3 clue. Rather than thinking that Cathy will blind-play, Bob will blind-play. 
  * EXAMPLE: Seen Reverse Finesse
   	* Nothing is on the stacks
   	* Alice clues Bob a 3 clue, and Bob sees a b1 in Donald’s finesse. Bob writes b2 on his slot 2 and waits a cycle.
  * EXAMPLE: Assumed Self-Finesse turns Pestilent (also works with not self-finesse)
   	* Nothing is on the stacks
   	* Alice clues Bob a 2 clue (on b2), and Bob does not see a 1 in Donald’s finesse. Thus, Bob plays her finesse-position. It plays as m1.
   	* Cathy sees that b2 will bomb as m2, and thus plays her finesse to resolve the pestilent double bluff 
   	* Note that in a normal hanabi game, such a move would never have been possible, since Bob would have waited for Cathy.
  * EXAMPLE: Assumed Finesse gets a spicy true finesse through pestilence
   	* B2 is on the stacks.
   	* Alice clues Donald a b4 with blue. 
   	* Bob does not entertain that Cathy has b3, and decides to blind-play, which turn out to be m1. Cathy sees this is pestilent and blind-plays, playing b3. 
   	* Donald knows that the only card that could’ve caused this is a b4, and plays it as blue 4. 
  * EXAMPLE: Assumed Direct-Play over Potential Finesse
   	* B1 is on the stacks
   	* Alice clues Bob a 2 clue. As long as Bob doesn’t see a 1 in Donad’s finesse, Bob will play the 2, not entertaining that Cathy will need to play something.
  * EXAMPLE: Assumed Direct-Play over Potential Prompt
   	* Cathy has a clued {r,m} card in her hand with no negative rank information
   	* Alice clues Bob one red in slot 3 with red
   	* Bob plays slot 3, not entertaining that it plays through Cathy’s red/rainbow card
  * EXAMPLE: Assume Direct-Play (ILLEGAL CLUE)
   	* B1 is on the stacks
   	* Alice clues Cathy a blue card. Bob will just write b2/m1 on Cathy’s card. Even if it becomes Cathy’s turn and she sees that Bob as b2/m1 in her hand and it normally could’ve been a finesse, this is just a direct-play clue, as this will never resolve otherwise. Thus Cathy believes she has b2/m1

  * **Unnecessary Blind-Play Assumption**
   	* If a push is done with known-trash on your shrouded player, you should assume that it is unnecessary. If you see no other blind-plays on other players, then the blind-play is on you.
  * **End-Game Push/Pull Assumption**
   	* In end-game, a blind-spot player should assume that the card that was clued has a meaning for what card location to be played (i.e. trash pull/push), and should assume an unnecessary trash pull/push over a double ignition. 
  * Self-color bluffs are off for clues to this player. They would be passed to the shrouded player as a reverse finesse.

#### Oblivious
* Cannot see the cards of the previous player
* Strategy
  * **Shrouded Cluemaster**: As with blindspot, Shrouded Cluemaster is a powerful strategy here. Note that it’s not as powerful as blind-spot Shrouded Cluemaster, since playing with blind-spot makes it very difficult to determine who should blind play, whereas oblivious is not as difficult.
  * If you want the shrouded player to blind play then the player before shrouded should bluff/finesse them normally. If you want both to blind play, use the 4s number double bluff override, or in late game a double ignition. If you want the oblivious player to blind play either 
  * Let the shrouded player bluff/finesse the oblivious player (say you are the player before shrouded, try discarding. It helps set up Shrouded Cluemaster) 
  * Give the shrouded player an obvious play clue so that the shrouded player can follow up with a discard to pass bluff.
* Conventions
  * All deferred play clues not acted upon in order to do something non-critical or non-finesse become a pass bluff to the Oblivious player
  * **Reverse Blind-Play Identification**
   	* If a clue is given to the shrouded player and demands a blind-play from the oblivious player, there are three ways to signal the blind-play. 
     	* Discard
     	* Give an early save that the oblivious player could have given
     	* Show that you think you are in a stall situation (e.g. 5 stall)
     	* A 1 for 1 clue that could have been given by the oblivious player. Note that if the 1 for 1 is given to the oblivious player, then it may be possible that both were direct-play clues and the oblivious player has a crucial chop.
      
   	* Put in a very human way, the oblivious player will blind-play if your shrouded player did something weird and inefficient, when he/she could have just played.
   	* For those giving clues for this line, you should generally prefer to minimize stress and give this clue when a discard can demonstrate it, or just give direct-play clues.
   	* Be careful as the shrouded player when giving 1 for 1s that may look like a bluff when you have a direct-play. Your oblivious partner would blind play from your hesitation and it would be ambiguous whether it was bluffed down, or reverse blind identified. We assume it is a bluff if the card oblivious plays does not match the shrouded’s card
    
   	* Example:
     	* all 1s on stack:
        * Shrouded is given p2 as purple, oblivious has r2 on finesse. Shrouded gives a clue to another player b3 as blue. The r2 was bluffed down, b3 is not playable
        * Shrouded is given r3 as red, oblivious has r2 on finesse. Shrouded gives a clue to another player, b2 as blue. The r2 was reverse finessed, b2 is playable.
        * Shrouded is given r2 as red, oblivious has m2 on finesse. Shrouded gives a clue to another player, b2 as blue. The m2 was hesitation finessed b2 is playable. (Note this is prone to causing desyncs, try not to do this).

  * **Clue Target Clandestine Distinction**
   	* Tl;dr: simple finesse > clandestine/layered > pestilent double/bluff
   	* If you are oblivious, and a clue is not targeted at you, then you should assume finesses are clandestine/layered finesse over a pestilent double finesse/bluff
   	* If a clue is targeted at you, then you should assume simple finesse over clandestine/layered.
   	* Assume Cathy is Oblivious of Bob:
     	* EXAMPLE: Assumed simple finesse
        * Alice clues an oblivious Cathy’s card with blue.
        * Bob plays b1 from finesse.
        * Cathy does not entertain that this is clandestine or a double finesse, and instead writes b2 on her card.
     	* EXAMPLE: Assumed clandestine finesse
        * Alice clues Donald’s blue 2 with blue.
        * Bob plays m1 from finesse.
        * Cathy sees that this is pestilent because it matches, but assumes that it will be clandestine instead.
   	* Additionally, in the edge case of an oblivious and blind-spot pairing together, all basic blind-plays (non double-bluffs) are being asked from the first player in play order.

#### Slow-witted
* Cannot see cards in slot 1
* Notes
  * Cards that you can’t see get included in your clues. You don’t know what they are though (you see what the person holding the cards would see). If the card later moves to slot 2, you get to see the full identity.
  * Cards touched in slot 1 get marked unclued unless they are a 5 or if they have gotten to chop and are globally known critical
  * Positional discards trying to get the slow-witted player’s slot 1 should be avoided unless it is the only viable method, as they will hesitate to see if anyone else plays first.
  * Slow-witted always wait for finesses to resolve from other players before playing their finesse or prompt. When it’s clear that a finesse is on them (everyone has deferred), the slow-witted player chooses between prompt and finesse normally.
* Strategy
  * The player just after the slow-witted player is best suited to give finesse that calls for a blind play from slow-witted, since the slow-witted player would watch as everyone else declines to blind play. This is very similar to the Shrouded Cluemaster role. But note that Shrouded Cluemaster is not as strong here, since slow-witted is able to play a relatively stress free game compared to oblivious/blind-spot
  * If it’s too hard to take the cards normally on finesse (because it’s a reverse finesse that slow-witted is going to play into), letting them fall off is a reasonable strategy because then slow-witted can give the finesse himself.
  * When Slow-Witted is in between clue-giver and clue receiver all resulting blind-plays are true finesses and not OOP Bluffs when the Slow-Witted player doesn’t play. The finesse can be passed back to the slow-witted player by everyone else not playing into it.
* Conventions
  * **Never Clue Impulsive**
   	* An accidental pick-up on impulsive may result in a blind-play bomb
  * **Double blind-play assumption**
   	* If a move can be proven to not be a finesse and calls for two consecutive blind-plays, then slow-witted should play
  * **Accidental Unclued**
   	* If a slow-witted player clues a player and picks up slot 1 (which they can not see), then the team should write “unclued” on the card an should be treated as unclued (unless it is a 5 or the card has reached chop and the team can globally prove that its unique identity and that it is critical or known playable)
  * **Trash Bluff over Trash Finesse**
   	* If a card is clued and someone needs to blind-play to demonstrate that it is trash, then the slow-witted player will act first.
  * This person’s clues engage everyone’s finesse positions 1-off. Thus, any finesse this player gives is from slot 2. This player gives ejections to slot 3 and discharges to slot 4.
  * This means that it is possible for slow-witted to perform lines that no one else can.
  * **Single Finesse assumption**
   	* If a slow-witted player receives a play clue and their teammate plays into this as a finesse, the slow-witted player should assume this finesse is not layered or through other teammates’ hands and that they have the next playable card. The same is not true of prompts. A slow-witted player may receive a play clue which requires multiple cards to be prompted out. That said, a prompt+finesse cannot be given to slow-witted that takes multiple rounds to resolve.
   	* A slow-witted player should assume that a clue focused on their own slot 1 as if it were the slot were just 5 pull’ed. through already known playable cards or immediately playable (like a 5 pull). This has a couple of implications:
   	* A clue from Alice to Slow-witted Bob’s slot 1 is never a finesse on other players (would be a reverse finesse since Bob goes after Alice) and is always an immediate play or prompt on Bob’s s1. The only exception is if there is no card that could possibly play correctly. In this case, it is never an assumed self-finesse, but instead, an assumed finesse on Cathy or Donald.
  * **Sanitation Bluff**: If a clue could be a finesse but would result in a matching finesse play that doesn’t resolve in time, a player must play their s1 in order to resolve it as a bluff. 
		* Example:
		* Nothing is on the stacks. Donald is slow-witted.
		* Alice clues Donald’s b3 with blue. 
		* Even though Bob sees that b1 is on Cathy’s slot 1 and thinks he has b2 that goes into Donald’s b3, Bob sees that there is a problem. Donald will play his card as b2 regardless of whether Bob has b2, because he is not entertaining anything in reverse. Thus, Bob must play something to resolve it. Bob plays his s1 and resolves the clue as a simple 3 bluff.
  * Reversed stacked finesesses are legal! If a 3 was given in the above example, Bob can have b2 in s2, and all will be good, as Donald knows his slot 1 isn’t playable. (not with color)
		* EXAMPLE: LAYERED
		* Nothing on the stacks
		* Bob    b1 b2 . .
		* Donald b3 . . . 
		* Alice can clue 3 to Donald to call for 3 bluff, and blue to Donald to call for layered/stacked.
    
  	* EXAMPLE: CLANDESTINE
   	* b1/g1 on the stacks
   	* Bob g2 b2 . .
   	* Donald b3 . . .
   	* Alice can clue blue to Donald to call for simple bluff, and 3 to Donald to call for clandestine. (Ok because Donald sees b2 in slot 2)
   	* Try not to delay finesses (to give more finesses) if the original finesse leads into the slow-witted player’s hand. This is formalized as you can only delay a finesse if you force the slow-witted player to blind play, or you are getting an epic efficiency clue (defined as getting at least 3 blind plays) that you think only you can give.
  * **Positional Bomb Interaction**
   	* A positional bomb of slot one does not immediately call for slow-witted’s slot 1. Slow-witted should wait.
   	* A positional bomb that calls for two plays when everyone sees that there are no plays available, calls for two plays from slot 1, one of which comes from the slow-witted player.

### Double Action
*Characters in this class must perform two of a certain action on their turn if they want to perform that action*
*Each action in the double action sequence counts as a discrete turn.*

#### Panicky
* After discarding, discards again if there are 4 clues or less
* Notes
  * Player picks their discards
  * Team gets a clue back for each discard
  * If Panicky starts their turn with 4 clues, you will only discard 1 card in total
  * 2 discards in the same turn generates 2 clues
* Conventions
    * A clue to panicky’s 1 off chop that is critical is interpreted as a save clue. This should only be used when there is no other way to force that player not to discard
  * If the player BEFORE panicky discards when there is a clue to be given not on finesse panicky is expected to give the clue
  * The panicky player will generally avoid discarding. This is formalized as - if there is a playable card in finesse of the bluff seat of the panicky player, the panicky player cannot discard. If there are any playables not on finesse, everyone can count on the panicky player not discarding. This is a bit tricky if there is a playable not on finesse and a duplicate of the playable on finesse for someone else - just be aware that some people might be counting on a play clue given.
  * **Pseudo Locked Hand**
   	* If Panicky has only 1 un-clued card to discard (and no known trash) and Panicky starts their turn with 3 or less clues, then they should be considered in a stall situation
   	* If they discard they would be forced to discard either a freshly drawn card or a clued card
  * **OOO Discards**
   	* If the player before the panicky player discarded, it either means they wanted the panicky player to give a clue or there were no clues to be given anywhere and panicky’s next two chop cards are good discards.
   	* If the latter is true, panicky should chop and 1 off chop
   	* If panicky discards chop first followed by 1 off chop, no information is conveyed
   	* If panicky discards 1 off chop first followed by chop, this is a delayed play clue (similar to 5 stall) on the player who goes before panicky
    
#### Genius
* When cluing, must clue a color and then a number (uses 2 clues)
* Notes
  * You must clue the same player with both clues
  * If left with 1 clue, you cannot clue or the game terminates
* Conventions
  * **Early Game Genius Exception**
   	* Everyone should be expecting genius to discard, even in early game
  * **Clue Meanings** 
   	* The focus from just the color clue alone is considered the focus of the clue pair. For the number clue, the genius should take the next best clue - which is
     	1. A useful clue (touching a new card: any of play, save chop. 5 stall). Note that the focus/chop should be what happens after the first clue. That is, the chop of the second clue may be different than the first one.
     	2. Burn by giving the number of any of the cards touched from the color clue. Ideally this is the “best fill in” (e.g. if it’s obvious that the color clue was a play clue it’s probably better to fill in the non-focused cards from the color clue). ‘Fill in” does not introduce any new cards
     	3. Burn by giving the number of any previously clued card not touched by your color clue. This is at the lowest tier to assist in calling for finesses. Note: this is still a valid burn if filling the number would bad touch, so this can’t self-finesse.
      
   	* The person who gets the clue will probably assume the number clue was useless. But other players can see whether this was violated and then know it is a finesse
   	* You are allowed to clarify the meaning of your color clue with the number clue. For example you can clue color to chop, then 5 to chop. This is just a normal 5 save clue and no cards will play from this, although very inefficient and should not be chosen generally.

### Order Reversal
* Contrarian is the only character in this class
#### Contrarian
* Play order inverts after taking a turn; 2-turn end game
* Notes
* Does not modify other character effects “previous” and “after” (note the stubborn is modified because it’s wording is “before”)
* Conventions
  * Everyone’s next player is changing every round, making it different who you can bluff
  * Order Chop Moves apply to the player who plays after the player who plays the 1.

### Repetitious
*Characters in this class must continue to perform a given action until a condition is met*

#### Insistent
* Must continue to clue the same cards until one of them is played or discarded
* Notes
  * Once a card is clued you cannot take any other action (e.g. discard, play, clue another player) until one of those cards are discarded or played. 
  * You can use different clues to fill in as long as it touches at least one of the cards you are already on the insistence for.
  * You need 1 card from the ORIGINAL insistence to get played/clued. E.g. you can’t escape by cluing 5, then cluing the color of the 5 touching an extra trash card, and having the trash be discarded. You are still not free from insistence.
* Conventions
  * This player cannot save unless it is the absolute last resort. Trash chop moves are reasonable, with some reduced flexibility since the receiver’s next turn is committed to discarding the trash. Misplay chop moves are OK in desperation.
  * This player cannot give bluffs, or 5CEs. You are allowed to abuse this to give stacked finesses that would normally be bluffs, but that would make you start having to burn clues, so not usually recommended. All players will prioritize unblocking the compulsion as quickly as possible.
  * Special moves involving trash are still good moves. E.g. a UTD on a bad touch card, or an unnecessary trash push. In the case of unnecessary trash push, note that the receiver needs to discard the trash before playing blind.
* While forced to give a clue as part of compulsion, player should as priority
  1. Fill in cards that are part of the compulsion as trash: this allows us to break the compulsion cycle if the original clue is a huge stacked finesse
  2. Any allowable clue following the stall order
  Therefore if the insistent player is avoiding filling trash, it’s actually another stacked finesse.
* All trash cm’s are necessary
* the focus of subsequent clues from insistent remains on the card initially clued.

#### Vindictive
* Must clue if they received a clue since their last turn
* Notes
  * Game terminates if this player is left with 0 clues and has received a clue since their last turn
* Strategy
  * The team can load up Vindictive with multiple clues in one round, so that Vindictive only loses one turn on being forced to clue.
  * Getting Vindictive players to play through blind play is preferred, so unless your detriment requires you to give a lot of clues, if you see a UTD, finesse, etc. option that can get a card from this players’ hand, take that opportunity.
  * Similar to insolent, avoid using bluff targets in this players hand
  * Prefer to save cards in other peoples’ hand as opposed to the Vindictive player’s hand.
* Conventions
  * This player can never be self-bluffed or self-finessed

#### Impulsive
* Must play slot 1 if it has been clued
* Conventions
  * All clues given to impulsive players which touch slot 1 are focused on slot 1.
  * Color clues to chop that are just-in-time may be saves, as they might just be given to avoid s1.
  * **Flaming finesse**
   	* If a double play needs to happen to prevent an impulsive bomb, players should treat this like blaze. 
     	* Example
      	* Alice clues Donald’s slot 1, a blue 4 which is 2 away from playable. 
      	* Bob sees that Cathy does not have blue 3 on finesse, a card that Cathy MUST play in order for there not to be a bomb. Instead Bob sees Cathy has b3 on the discharge slot and Alice plays the discharge slot (b2) to communicate it. (similar to blaze)
      	* In addition, if a play of a unique card is being demanded from Cathy from the wrong slot, it also calls for a flaming finesse for a one-away-from-playable clue.
			* Example
      	* Alice clues an impulsive Donald’s slot 1 as y5, and y3 is on the stacks.
      	* Bob sees Cathy’s unclued y4 in slot 2 (second-finesse position). 
      	* If Bob can prove that he can not play y4 from finesse or prompt, he should play his matching-finesse position. That is, if:
      	* Bob has negative yellow information for his entire hand, OR
      	* Bob sees 2 y4s in Cathy’s hand, both not on finesse OR
      	* Bob sees a y4 in Donald’s hand or in the trash
      	* Then Bob should play the matching finesse position of Cathy’s y4 to signal to Cathy which card is the y4. 

### General Conventions
#### Unnecessary Chop Move Assumption
* All UTDs (that do not pick up other good cards) and trash bluffs are assumed to call for an unnecessary chop move in order to prevent chop move desync. All cards to the right of the right-most clued card should be chop moved. 
#### Slow-witted and Vindictive Exception
* Because getting blind-plays out of vindictive and slow-witted is extremely hard, if a play comes out of slow-witted’s s2-4 or Vindictive, then everyone should assume that no chop move was done. 
#### Finesse Positions Through Chop Moves
* Even if a a card is chop moved, it is still considered as a potential finesse position
#### Unnecessary GD Chop Move
* If your detriment does not make it optimal to GD, a 1 for 1 GD calls for a CM on the player to whom the play was passed
#### Stall sequence
  1. Clue an untouched playable card or a critical save
  2. A save clue
	3. 5 stall
	4. Tempo clue (if there is a higher ranked available clue in the stall sequence to give and a tempo clue is given, it calls for a TCCM)
	5. Locked Hand Save: save a non-critical card on chop (not if it will lock someone’s hand)
	6. Fill in 
	7. Hard burn (given in a “top down” order starting with the very next player you’re able to clue)
    * Start with any 5’s if available, then work down in rank
    * Prefer 5 on the player who will take a turn after you, then 5 on next next player, then 5 on next next next player. Then 4 on next player.
	8. Clue Restricted Save
	9. Save any card not on chop (really try to avoid this b/c it will look like a finesse- maybe we even remove this from the available options)

#### 1-away screams only on strictly critical cards (only one copy left)

#### “Hard” Variant Rules
* Abolish early 5 stall (hard style)
* 5 stall when in stalling sequence is still good. 5 saving chop is still a good move in early game, and is not going to be read as LPC.
* No finesse position exception
* DDA is on (easy style. See: Stall sequence)
* LPC is generally off (easy style), but LPC is on if there are clue-giving or clue-receiving restrictions (hard style, in mid-game).
* A color-blind player (or any clue receiving restriction) views clues that are potentially blocked by the restriction as with LPC. See: CRR Save
* A mood-swings player (or any clue giving restriction) views clues she gives with LPC.
* LPC negativity: Players generally try to avoid discarding if something is playable. A single discard is enough to help convince someone that a follow up save clue to chop is likely a save over a play.

#### Charms 
* Can be triggered by “Declined 5 pull”
* If Duck: “cluing a 4 when it is 3 away from playable”

#### Positional bombs with known trash
* If the leftmost known trash is positional played (the one that would’ve normally been discarded), this calls for only one card

#### No Batons
* All batons (not in a stall situation) should be read as layered gentlemans discards. For example:
* Nothing is on the stacks
* Alice discards a known b2
* Bob and Cathy should assume that between the two of them they have b1, b2 on finesse
* If Bob sees b2 in Cathy’s hand 
* If Bob does not also see b1, Bob should play the finesse position of Cathy’s b2. If it’s not a matching b1, it is a globally known bluff
* If Bob sees b1 in Cathy’s hand, refer to the Sly Gentleman for Bob’s course of action.
* If Bob does not see b2 in Cathy’s hand
* If Bob does not also see b1 in Cathy’s hand, Bob should play his finesse until he plays b1, b2
* If Bob sees b1 in Cathy’s hand, Bob should hesitate and let Cathy play her b1. After Cathy plays her b1, Bob should play the matching finesse position of Cathy’s b1 play if Alice does not fix.

#### 7 Clue End Game Speedup
* In end game, if Alice has 7 clues, Alice may bomb her right-most known trash or, in the case she doesn’t have known trash, her right-most untouched card as a speedup maneuver. If she does so, no one is expected to play. You can not do this if there is a play on the board! Otherwise 8 clues will not be reached and you should just clue and let the other person without a play discard.

### Discard Order.
We found in helpful to agree on a preferred discard priority among the characters. This helped us modulate among players based off of who we wanted to draw cards throughout the game.

Highest on the list should prefer discarding, and lowest should prefer not discarding. Of course getting players with trash to discard is always advantageous.
* Wasteful, Traumatized, Anxious
  * These players have restrictions on when they can discard, so if they are eligible for discard should consider it
* Genius. The burning of clues especially in the early game is very annoying and the genius should tend to discard unless they can justify a good double clue.

**EARLY SAVE OK BOUNDARY** - If you are below this line you can give an early save and feel ok about it
* All Clue Giving Restrictions. If the game progresses with these players discarding and continually getting asked to play, we will have smooth sailing
* Fuming, Dumbfounded, Inept, Awkward, Conservative, Greedy, Picky, Compulsive, Mood Swings, Quacker. 
  * With only clue giving restrictions, these characters should prefer discarding. The worse your ability to give clues, the more you’d prefer (For example, Quacker giving clues is generally terrible, Greedy is also heavily restricted in what clues they can give).
* Slow-witted
  * The low visibility makes this a good character to discard
* Insistent
  * This character has clue giving restrictions on saving + giving bluffs. Ideally this player discards, since the inability to give bluffs makes her a poor offense character compared to other characters
* Color-blind, Vulnerable (Clue Receiving Restricted). 
  * Distinguishing saves and plays in these hands are annoying. But because we can utilize LPC and priority, these players should feel neutral with discarding
* Impulsive. 
  * This character is annoying if their slot 1 overlaps with their chop, and their chop needs to be saved (e.g. slot 1 and 4 are both 5s, or slot 1 is m4 and slot 4 is critical r4). However this specific situation should be fairly rare enough to make this a more or less neutral character on discards.

**EARLY SAVE RECOMMENDED BOUNDARY** - If you are below this line you can give an early save and feel good about it
* Oblivious, Blind Spot, Spiteful, Insolent. 
  * These players discarding can put extra strain on the other 2 players who need to save your hand and the shrouded/uncluable hand put together.

**AVOID LOCKING BOUNDARY** - if you are below this line you will probably not be used as a bluff target, and people will avoid trying to fill up your hand
* Vindictive: 
  * This player tries to avoid discarding, because of the hassle of getting cards out of Vindictive’s hand
* Hesitant. 
  * This character effectively has a hand size of 3. The team will be in a sticky situation if all 3 of these are critical
* Follower, Indolent. 
  * These characters have trouble playing cards. Follower tends to make early game very challenging when locked, and indolent has late game trouble when they have too many cards
  
**PANG OF GUILT BOUNDARY** - If you are below this line you can give pang of guilts and not feel bad about it. This character can still discard, but the team may be relying on avoiding the multiple discards. When this character can make exactly 1 discard, it is probably still worth discarding.
* Panicky

**Floaters:**
* Stubborn should be playing at the opposite spectrum as the player they are stubborn too. But of course, the player before stubborn is going to choose what stubborn does.
* Contrarian: A neutral character
* Miser: This player generally cannot give clues. When able to give clues they might prefer giving them, but will generally be forced to discard
  * Note that if you are right in front of the miser, you might want to avoid discards. Potentially DDA stopper, although other players should be helping out.
5 pulls are less valuable because 5 stalls are good to have
