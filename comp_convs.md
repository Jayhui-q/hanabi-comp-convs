# Competition Convention Catalogue

This document records all of the Hanabi convention history for all of the Hanabi competitions that I played in previously, and will be regularly updated (with up to a month's delay) after a competition ends. Our hope is that these conventions serve as inspiration for fellow competitors, future community conventions, or as just fun ideas to ruminate on about the way the game could be played. 

These competitions are played on https://hanab.live/ and are located [here](https://hanabi-competitions.com/).

The conventions below all build upon community conventions found [here](https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/blob/master/Reference.md). If they are not specified to be altered by a competition-specific convention, then the community conventions were assumed. As a reminder, these competitions have bottom-deck blind-play enabled and also have a turn count emphasis -- they are designed with the goal of performing well in the competitions and may not be optimal for synchronous performance in normal games. In addition, they were playtested with a specific number of players in mind (as compared to being applicable for 3-6 players). They were also practiced with at-length (!) 

Massive massive credits go to **rkass, avanderwalde, kevincaseytdk1, and kyle** for being a amazing parts of my competition teams and all of the awesome memories we have made together in these competitions.

As usual, Alice, Bob, Cathy, Donald, and Emily are names used for players in that order. 
Alice is assumed to be the person performing the action unless otherwise noted. 

# 2020 T3 Standard Series
Results can be found [here](https://hanabi-competitions.com/series/2020%20T3%20Standard)

2p White Reversed (6 Suits), and 2p Clue Starved (6 Suits) are ommitted, as I did not compete in either. 2020 T3 Standard Series was our team's first competition series.

For all 3 player competitions, the team composition was avanderwalde, rkass, and I (JerryYang).
For all 4 player competitions, the team composition included kevincaseytdk1 as well.

## 3p No Variant [9/14]
### General Notes
* Loaded play clues are turned on in mid-game.
* No 5-Stalls are allowed in early game (unless left with 8 clues, DDA, or otherwise locked). 
* Delaying blind-plays for priority reasons is strictly illegal.

#### Allowable Chop Moves
* In early game, chop moves are only allowed on 2's and 5's.
* This serves to faciliate reads on what the chop moved cards are for blind-plays without any additional context.

#### Priority Changes
* Priority bluffs can always be done out of position. That is, if Alice commits a play out of priority, and Bob sees a playable card on finesse, Bob is not promised a playable or the matching card on finesse. Instead, Cathy is asked to blind-play.
* For two playables that aren't completely known, the card that was most recently clued has the priority.

#### 4 Double Bluff Override
* When deciding between a 4 double bluff and a finesse, the player should assess whether or not it will take him or her 2+ blind-plays to fufill the finesse. If so, then it is a double bluff. Otherwise it is a finesse.
* This comes at a very noticeable tradeoff of giving a 4 as a finesse when Bob has two or more cards of the matching suit.

#### 5s Chop Move Assumption
* Even if a player is in DDA or is another stall situation, a 5 clue that is 1 away from chop is still read as a chop move.

## 4p Rainbow (6 Suits) [9/28]  -- "Clue Partners"
In this competition, players were only allowed to clue accross the table. That is, Alice may only clue Cathy, Bob may only clue Donald, Cathy may only clue Alice, and Donald may only clue Bob.

### General Notes
* Unnecessary Interpretations are **almost always off**. After all, there are only 4 possible cards to touch.
* It is strictly illegal to delay a finesse with a bluff. We found the risk too high when clues were difficult to give to re-sync the team.
* 4 Double Bluff Override is on.
* DDA is on, Loaded Play clues are off, and 5 stalls in early game are off unless in a stall sitaution.

### Duplication 1 Conventions
These conventions refer to when a player has unknown 1's in their hand. They are created because sometimes only the player with the 1s can clue the other player with 1s.

#### 1 Color Promise
* If Alice has an unknown 1, and clues color to Cathy's chop, and it is not a finesse or bluff, then Cathy is promised that color 1 (not rainbow).
* Note: Alice should not do the 1 Color Promise if that card is not unique on the table (for example, if Bob also has the same 1).

#### Multi 1 Promise
* If Alice has an unknown 1, and clues a rank 1 to Cathy's Chop, and it is not a bluff or push, then Cathy is promised multi 1 on chop. If multiple 1's are touched, Cathy should assume all 1's are good until a fix is given.
* Note: Alice should not do the multi 1 promise if that card is not unique on the table.

#### Duplication 1's Chop Move
* If Alice has an unknown 1, and clues a 1 that is not on chop, the clue receiver should chop move (as the 1 clue was clearly urgent). Cathy should assume all 1's are good until a fix is given.

### Early Game Conventions
#### Early Game Quarantine
* On turns 1-2, discarding is prohibited. On turns 3-4, if a player was chop saved via a direct clue or order chop move, discarding is also prohibited (as no one may have had the chance to save you). Stall clues must be given instead. 
* In addition, if your clue partner was forced into blind-playing, then you are also prohibited from discarding. 
* A player can only end early-game when their partner had the opportunity to save them, and did not.

#### Opening Clue Burn
* A 4 rank clue given on turns 1 and 2 is simply a burn unless other players could see a better clue to be given. 
* On the 4-clue receivers' first turn, the clued 4 is considered the chop (i.e. discard the 4, from left to right if there are multiple).  An opening 4 clue'd card that is not discarded immediately is no longer considered trash, and should be kept as good touch
* Choosing to not discard the leftmost clued 4 is a * scream discard * 
* If on turn 1 Alice sees that Cathy has only 2s and 3s without a 2 on chop, Alice should clue number 2 to Cathy’s non-chop. Bob can see that Alice had nothing better to do and will not play into it as a finesse. Cathy assumes that a 1 would have been given for clarity if it were a self-finesse. 

#### 5s Chop Move Candidates
* A 5 CM in early game must either be on a good 2 or the duplicate of the card to the left of it.
* Do not CM an arbitrary 3 / 4 in the early game - you are likely to lock the player. If another player has this same 3 / 4 on chop it is OK to cm this. Note that toward mid/late game you can cm an arbitrary good 3 / 4 especially if it is 1 away from playable.

### Other Conventions
#### Duplication UTD
* If two good cards are intentionally duplicated with a clue, then the clue calls for a discharge on the very next player (play -> trash/dupe)

#### Modified Stall Clues
* In DDA, scream discard, locked hand or 8 clues, a stall clue must be given in the follow order of precedence.
  1. Non-chop color play clue
  2. Chop-focus save or direct play clue
  3. 5 stall (touching a new 5)
  4. Tempo Clue
  5. Fill-in Clue
  6. Clear Burn Clue (e.g. re-clue known 5s, reclue known cards with number)
  7. Number clue not on chop. (Considered good touch, but not asked to be played)

* If other players could see a better clue to be given, then it is in fact a play clue to be played into by others and the clue receiver will only know after a blind-play is done. 
* NOTE: there is no such thing as a locked hand save. This is done so clues on chop can actually have meaning. Stall situations are a common occurrence in this competition.

#### Occupied 1-1 Chop Move (Mid-Game)
* A 1 for 1 play clue that does not touch chop when a player has something to do chop moves the clue receiver. That is, if Alice gives a 1 for 1 to Cathy when Alice already has a play, Cathy should chop move. If the clue was to a chop card this is a normal play / save that does not call for a chop move.

#### Bad Tempo Clue Bluff 
* Alice can give a tempo clue to Cathy that would chop move a trash card in order to get Bob to play his finesse position (not a clue on something globally known as playable, otherwise it's a double play ejection). To counteract the chop move on a bad card, Bob blind-plays.
* NOTE: bear in mind that a tempo clue does not call for a chop move when the clue giver is in a stall situation and could not see other play/save clues to give in their partner's hand.

#### 1-Away Scream
* If Alice is left with 0 clues and Bob has a critical card on chop, Alice should trust that the team has permitted her to perform a 1-Away Scream. That is, Alice discards 1 slot to the left of chop rather than her chop. 
* Following the 1-away scream, Bob should chop move.

#### Blazing Lies
* If a gentleman’s discard occurs that lies about the position of the card but gets a free finesse position play, but it can be fixed with a single clue, it is not a blaze discard. Instead it is a layered gentleman's discard with a fix.
* For example, supposed blue 1 and green 1 is on the stacks. Alice discards a playable and clued blue 2. Cathy's hand holds a playable red 1 on finesse, followed by green 1, and blue 2. 
* In the blazing lie convention, Bob should not blind-play his third finesse position. Instead, Bob should let Cathy play slot 1 as red 1, and know that Alice will fix it in the next turn.
* This convention is created due to the unlikelihood of blazes (when players in this ruleset are often giving immediate play clues), as well as permitting transfers of cards from Alice to Bob or Alice to Donald more smoothly. 
* Note,  you cannot “skip fixing” (as a weird way of trying to rewrite original as a blazing truth)

#### End-Game Color Choice
* In end-game, if a rainbow card could have been focused by rank, and is instead focused by color, it is an ask for the very next player to play the slot corresponding to the stacks. (Purple is slot 4, Blue is slot 3, Green is slot 2, Yellow is slot 1, and red is an undefined emergency, signalling that it was unfocusable)

#### End-Game Desperation
* If you cannot use either of the other conventions to get a particular card to play as a last ditch desperation you can try a number clue to give the slot to be played. Do not use this unless there is no other mechanism - the end game color choice signaling red may be stronger.

## 3p Duck (5 Suits) 10/26
### General Notes
* All hyphenated conventions apply unless this document conflicts with hyphenated, in which case conventions in this document take precedence. See [Duck](https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/blob/master/variant-specific/Duck.md) and [No Positive Clues](https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/blob/master/variant-specific/No_Positive_Clues.md) (In particular, 1’s promise, 3 discharge, and 4 charm)
* Keep an eye out for occupied play clues

### Conventions Switched Off
* Bluffs (except for when bluffing out 5's)
* Hesitation Blind-Play
* Tempo Clue Chop Moves, Order Chop Moves
* DDA
* 5 Chop Move, Stall, Pull, and its extensions
* Priority Finesse, Prompt, Bluff
* Double Finesses
* Fake Saves
* Relaxed 2 Saves

### Additional Conventions
#### LPC and OPC
* Loaded Play Clues and Occupied Play Clues are always on the entire game, even in early game
* Addendum: For clarity, occupied play clues are stricly only when Alice clues Cathy

#### Promised Play Order
* Play clues and prompts should always be played in the order that they were received (unless it is clear that they are both directly playable)

#### 1's Re-Clue Order
* Often in the beginning of the game 1’s are clued on chop and then subsequently re-clued in order to communicate that they are 1’s. In this case, the recipient should play their 1’s from right to left, stopping after playing a non-1.

#### DDA Responsbility
* DDA is off. In the event that the next two players do not have a play and they have identical cards on chop, you should save the first player's discard. This clue is read as a save, unless the discard that occurs does not match the initial clue. 
  * The player who received the clue should mark down all cards in trash as well as the very next player’s chop (and play or other save interpretations)
* If you are in DDA and see a play clue or save clue to give you must give it

#### 2/5 Color Save Finesse 
* When a color clue rather than number is clearly given (via other touched cards) to a non critical 2 or a 5, this is read as a finesse/ejection (as it would be in normal game).

#### Modified Stall Sequence
If a player is screamed at, has 8 clues without a playable, or has a locked hand, they should follow the below priority when cluing. 
  1. Normal play/save clue 
  2. Burn clue (refocuses a card that was already clued. Should not trigger a DPE or a tempo clue if no normal play/saves can be seen) 
  3. Locked Hand Save (not promised good) 

So in a stall situation, if Cathy has a card that could've been focused in as a burn, but Alice clues something not playable /saveable on Cathy's chop instead, Bob reads it as a finesse, or a special move. Alternatively, if Cathy sees that a direct play clue/save clue could've been given (not a possible dupe), then Cathy knows that a burn to her was indeed a tempo clue or a clue to chop was a play/save

#### UTD Suppress
* Unknown Trash Discharges are turned off (this includes duplication discharges) until all of the 1’s have been played, because at this point 3 discharges are impossible. 
* This is done so that a player knows whether or not to write a 3 on their card (via a 3 discharge) or kt.

#### Double Finesse Suppress
* Double Finesses are turned off in favor of ejections, discharges, and charms which may be performed out of order as well. 
* For example:
  * Red 1 on stacks. Bob has a Red 2 which has been clued as a play. Alice quacks at Bob's Blue 3. Bob plays Red 2. Cathy plays her discharge signaling that Bob’s Blue 3 was clued as a 3 discharge.

#### Chop Moved Finessable 
* Cards which have been chop moved are counted as untouched when counting finesse positions and are therefore eligible to be finessed, ejected, discharged, and charmed.

#### Early 5-5 Blast
* In early game, if someone has a fifth finesse position, a 5 clue to a two or more away from playable card that’s not on chop is a signal for the next person to play their fifth finesse position. (early game ends when unknown trash gets discarded)
* If a player does not have a fifth finesse position, it’s a normal 5 ejection
* Cannot be performed out of position

#### Special Move Finesse Default
* If a special move is given and the target does not have the corresponding finesse position, it’s a finesse. For example, if a 3 discharge is given from Alice to Cathy but Bob doesn’t have a 3rd finesse position, this is a finesse.

#### Half Information Prompt Rule
* When deciding between a prompt or a finesse, a prompt should be chosen if the information on that card matches at least half-way. That is, after getting information about a previous clue that could’ve been either a rank or a color clue, those respective colors count towards choosing a prompt over a finesse to connect into a matching clue. NOTE: this rule only applies to cards that are not known to be playable. 
* Example 1:
  * Red 1 and Blue 1 are on the stacks 
  * Alice quacks at Bob’s slot 1 and slot 2
  * Bob plays slot 1 and sees that it is red 2. Bob marks that his slot 2 is either red or 2. 
  * Cathy clues a blue 3 to Alice, and Bob is promised b2 on his slot 2, unless Alice blind-plays.
* Example 2:
  * Alice quacks at Cathy’s slot 1 and 2
  * Bob plays his charm slot, indicating to Cathy that her slot 1 is a 4. 
  * Later, Alice clues Bob a b3, which is not playable.
  * Cathy should not play her prompt. Instead the clue is either a finesse or a special move.

#### Chop Prompt Exception
* Cards clued on chop in early game should never be played as 1-prompts or 2-prompts unless there is context to rule them out as 5’s

#### Out-Of-Position Specials
* Because of play-order promise, special moves can be done out of position with clarity. For clarity, the special moves can only be done a player that is already loaded. 
* Otherwise, it is a finesse or prompt.

#### Double Save Rewrite
* If a clue to chop that was initially seen as LPC is followed up immediately by another clue to chop, both should be assumed as saves.

#### Unnecessary dupe 1's at Beginning Game
* If a player holds 1s and decides to give 1s as a play clue, and the very next player has a blast spot, then the next player should eject.

#### Re-clue Right Focus Exception
* If a card is already determined, then a clue that re-clues more than 1 card is focused on the non-determined card

#### End-Game Double Plays
* When all 4 cards are either on the stacks or globally known, then it is possible to perform an unnecessary trash bluff. Once this is given, two plays are called for, read as a trash pull or trash push. If neither of these are playable, then it is a special move and not a trash bluff. 
  * For example: Alice clues Cathy trash on slot 3 Because all 4’s are down or clued, Cathy could not possibly read it as a finesse if Bob plays slot 1. Bob suspects this is an unnecessary trash pull. Bob looks at Cathy’s slot 4, to the right of the trash card. If it is playable, Bob knows that he should play finesse to trigger the trash pull. 
  * If Bob doesn’t see that the trash push/pull is playable, then Bob should discharge like a normal UTD. If Cathy sees this UTD was unnecessary and trash would not be valuable, Cathy plays her finesse position. Beyond positional misplays, this covers Bob’s slot 1 and slot 3 and any slot of Cathy

#### Playable 4’s non-screamable
* A player may not scream to save a playable, non-critical 4

#### 2 Save Obligation 
* Relaxed 2 Saves, from the Duck document, is off.
* Without context, you have to save 2 even if you might have the matching 2 in hand. 

#### Sarcastic Assumption
* You don’t need half information to assume sarcastic. 
* That said, gentlemans are still possible if you can rule out sarcastic. 

#### "Tempo clues" may be delayed play clues, or finesses

#### DPE vs Trash Fix
* A clue focusing a playable card on Bob is a trash fix. On Cathy, it’s a DPE.
* DPEs can only be given on clued cards (not finessed, known "playables")
